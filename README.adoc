= Annotation-driven MCP Java SDK

Declarative https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk[MCP Java SDK] Development with Java Annotations - No Spring Framework Required.

Focus on your core logic (resources/prompts/tools) - Not SDK low-level details. Instant MCP Java server in 1 LOC.

== Showcase

Just put this one line code in your `main` method:

[source,java]
----
// You can use this annotation to specify the base package
// to scan for MCP resources, prompts, tools, but it's not required.
@McpComponentScan(basePackage = "com.github.codeboyzhou.mcp.examples")
public class MyMcpServer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Start a STDIO MCP server
        McpServers.run(MyMcpServer.class, args).startSyncStdioServer("mcp-server", "1.0.0");
        // or a HTTP SSE MCP server
        // McpServers.run(MyMcpServer.class, args).startSyncSseServer("mcp-server", "1.0.0");
    }

}
----

No need to care about the low-level details of native MCP Java SDK and how to create the MCP resources, prompts, and tools. Just annotate them like this:

[source,java]
----
@McpResources
public class MyMcpResources {

    // This method defines a MCP resource to expose the OS env variables
    @McpResource(uri = "env://variables", name = "env", description = "OS env variables")
    public String getSystemEnv() {
        // Just put your logic code here, forget about the MCP SDK details.
        return System.getenv().toString();
    }

    // Your other MCP resources here...
}
----

[source,java]
----
@McpTools
public class MyMcpTools {

    // This method defines a MCP tool to read a file
    @McpTool(name = "read_file", description = "Read complete file contents with UTF-8 encoding")
    public String readFile(
        @McpToolParam(name = "path", description = "filepath", required = true) String path) {
        // Just put your logic code here, forget about the MCP SDK details.
        return Files.readString(Path.of(path));
    }

    // Your other MCP tools here...
}
----

Now it's all set, run your MCP server, choose one MCP client you like and start your MCP exploration journey.

[WARNING]

Please note that this project is under development and is not ready for production use.

== Getting Started

=== Requirements

== What is MCP?

The https://modelcontextprotocol.io[Model Context Protocol (MCP)] lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. Think of it like a web API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

- Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
- Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
- Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
- And more!

You can start exploring everything about *MCP* from https://modelcontextprotocol.io[here].
